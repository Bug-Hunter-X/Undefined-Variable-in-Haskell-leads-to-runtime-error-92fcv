# Haskell Undefined Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Haskell caused by using the `undefined` value.  The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` offers a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to perform an operation on an undefined variable, leading to a runtime exception.

The solution showcases proper variable initialization to avoid this type of error.
